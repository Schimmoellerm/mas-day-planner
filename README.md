# mas-day-planner

This project is a single day planner that will display the current day and time dynamically. It contains nine time blocks set to the standard 9-5 work day. Each of these has save button off to the right side that will store the input content to the local storage. If a user opens up the application later it will pull the information from local storage that was saved and display it in the input box.
The input boxes will also automatically update based on the time of day to change the background color. The color for past hours will be grey, current hour will be red and future hours will be green.
